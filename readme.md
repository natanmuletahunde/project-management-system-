  ## Weekly Progress
  ```
  
  {
  Frontend: Next.js (React) with Tailwind CSS for UI styling and responsive design
  Backend API: Node.js with Express.js
  Database: PostgreSQL (managed with pgAdmin for database administration)
  Currently, most of the core functionalities are already implemented — including task creation, project assignment, task status handling, and UI integration between the client and server.
  1 Deploying the application – deploying both the frontend and backend to a production hosting platform
  2 Finalizing JWT authentication – applying secure token-based authentication and authorization to protect routes and user data
}
